We really appreciate pull requests and bug reports, here are our guidelines:

1. If filing a bug report, please verify the issue is with Critical first. A good sanity check is:
does the issue have to do with styles not being correctly captured? If so, test with [Penthouse](https://github.com/pocketjoso/penthouse).
If it works with Penthouse then it's a Critical bug and we encourage you to open up a [new ticket](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical/issues/new) with details.
Does the bug have to do with inlining styles, general module failures or installation issues? Those are also
possibly Critical bugs and we will strive to take a look at them.
1. Working on a patch? File a bug at https://github.com/addyosmani/critical/issues (if there
isnâ€™t one already). If your patch is going to be large it might be a good idea
to get the discussion started early. We are happy to discuss it in a new issue beforehand.
1. Make sure that patches provide justification for why they should be merged.
